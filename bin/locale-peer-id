# Print a locale peer id.
#
# A local peer id is:
#
# * A  32-character lowercase hexadecimal string.
#
# * Created by a secure random generator such as /dev/urandom.
#
# A locale peer id is not a UUID:
#
# * A locale peer id is deliberately entirely random, whereas a UUID has variations, and even the UUID-4 random variation is not entirely random.
#
# * A locale peer id specifies the use of a secure random generator such as `/dev/urandom`, whereas a UUID is not entirely random and does not specify the use of a a secure random generator.
